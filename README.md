Hello ðŸ‘‹

Iâ€™m Jecan, or call me JC. I'm a developer, curious adventurer (traveled over 30 countries and lived in 3 continents) + love for climbing.


Based in The Netherlands, I'm a EDA and DDD practitioner, currently using Laravel, Nuxt, Vue and also interested in Big data, ML/AI, DevOps, Go and Rust. In simplicity, I'm a passionate and pragmatic developer with an interest in interdisciplinary humanistic and technological disciplines carrying a strong passion in solving problems and optimizing solutions.
